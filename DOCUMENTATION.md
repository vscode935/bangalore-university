## 🟧 STAGE 5 — ROUND 1 SCORING

**Purpose:** Record performances and calculate rankings

### TRACK EVENTS — TIME-BASED SCORING

**Time Format:** MM:SS.MS (Minutes:Seconds.Milliseconds)

**Entry Example:**
```
Athlete 101: 10.45 seconds
Athlete 102: 10.56 seconds
Athlete 103: 10.68 seconds
```

**Conversion to Milliseconds:**
```
10.45s = 10450 ms
10.56s = 10560 ms
10.68s = 10680 ms
```

**Ranking Logic:**
- LOWER TIME = BETTER RANK
- Sort times ascending: 10450ms → Rank 1, 10560ms → Rank 2, 10680ms → Rank 3

**Round 1 Results Format:**

| Rank | Bib # | Name | College | Performance | Points |
|------|-------|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | 1001 | Rajesh Kumar | RVCE | 10.45s | |
| 2 | 1002 | Priya Sharma | BMSCE | 10.56s | |
| 3 | 1003 | Amit Patel | MSRIT | 10.68s | |

### JUMP/THROW EVENTS — DISTANCE-BASED SCORING

**Distance Format:** Meters with 2 decimal precision (e.g., 5.62m, 61.05m)

**Entry Example (Long Jump):**
```
Athlete 201: Attempt 1: 5.62m, Attempt 2: 5.71m, Attempt 3: 5.69m
Best = 5.71m
```

**Ranking Logic:**
- HIGHER DISTANCE = BETTER RANK
- Sort distances descending: 5.71m → Rank 1, 5.64m → Rank 2, 5.59m → Rank 3

**Round 1 Results Format:**

| Rank | Bib # | Name | College | Best | Attempts |
|------|-------|------|---------|------|----------|
| 1 | 1201 | Arun Singh | RVCE | 5.71m | 5.62, 5.71, 5.69 |
| 2 | 1202 | Zara Khan | BMSCE | 5.64m | 5.58, 5.64, 5.61 |
| 3 | 1203 | Maya Gupta | MSRIT | 5.59m | 5.55, 5.59, 5.54 |

### RELAY EVENTS — TEAM TIME SCORING

**Ranking Logic:**
- Team with LOWEST TIME = Rank 1
- Example:
  - Team A: 42.12s → Rank 1
  - Team B: 42.45s → Rank 2
  - Team C: 42.78s → Rank 3

**Round 1 Results Format:**

| Rank | Team | College | Members (Bibs) | Performance |
|------|------|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| 1 | Team A | RVCE | 1001,1002,1003,1004 | 42.12s |
| 2 | Team B | BMSCE | 1005,1006,1007,1008 | 42.45s |
| 3 | Team C | MSRIT | 1009,1010,1011,1012 | 42.78s |

### COMBINED EVENTS — AFI POINTS SYSTEM

**AFI (Athletics Federation of India) Scoring Formula:**

```
Points = A × (B – P)^C
```

Where:
- A = Coefficient
- B = Reference value
- C = Exponent
- P = Performance

**Men's Decathlon Coefficients:**

| Event | A | B | C | Notes |
|-------|---|---|---|----|
| 100m | 25.4347 | 18 | 1.81 | Lower time = higher points |
| Long Jump | 0.14354 | 220 | 1.4 | Distance in cm |
| Shot Put | 51.39 | 1.5 | 1.05 | Distance in meters |
| High Jump | 0.8465 | 75 | 1.42 | Height in cm |
| 400m | 0.196 | 82 | 1.81 | Time in seconds |
| 110m Hurdles | 5.74352 | 28.5 | 1.92 | Time in seconds |
| Discus | 12.91 | 4 | 1.1 | Distance in meters |
| Pole Vault | 0.2007 | 100 | 1.35 | Height in cm |
| Javelin | 10.07 | 7 | 1.08 | Distance in meters |
| 1500m | 0.03768 | 480 | 1.85 | Time in seconds |

**Women's Heptathlon Coefficients:**

| Event | A | B | C |
|-------|---|---|---|
| 100m Hurdles | 9.23076 | 26.7 | 1.835 |
| High Jump | 1.84523 | 75 | 1.348 |
| Shot Put | 56.0211 | 1.5 | 1.05 |
| 200m | 4.99079 | 42.5 | 1.81 |
| Long Jump | 0.188807 | 210 | 1.41 |
| Javelin | 15.9803 | 3.8 | 1.04 |
| 800m | 0.11193 | 254 | 1.88 |

**Calculation Example (100m Men, Performance 11.20s):**

```
A = 25.4347
B = 18
C = 1.81
P = 11.20

Points = 25.4347 × (18 – 11.20)^1.81
       = 25.4347 × (6.80)^1.81
       = 25.4347 × 32.423
       ≈ 825 points
```

**Long Jump Example (708 cm):**

```
A = 0.14354
B = 220
C = 1.4
P = 708 (in cm)

Points = 0.14354 × (708 – 220)^1.4
       = 0.14354 × (488)^1.4
       = 0.14354 × 5,891.2
       ≈ 846 points
```

**Combined Event Scoring:**

| Event | Performance | Points |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 100m | 11.20s | 825 |
| Long Jump | 7.08m | 846 |
| Shot Put | 14.50m | 712 |
| High Jump | 1.95m | 891 |
| 400m | 52.30s | 654 |
| **Day 1 Total** | — | **3,928 points** |
| 110m Hurdles | 14.80s | 823 |
| Discus | 45.20m | 734 |
| Pole Vault | 4.80m | 756 |
| Javelin | 68.50m | 892 |
| 1500m | 4:15.30 | 691 |
| **Day 2 Total** | — | **3,896 points** |
| **TOTAL** | — | **7,824 points** → **Rank 1** |

- Rank 1, 3, 5, 7 → Heat 1
- Rank 2, 4, 6, 8 → Heat 2

**Lane Assignments (Fixed Order):**

```
1st → Lane 3  (center-left)
2nd → Lane 4  (center-right)
3rd → Lane 2  (left)
4th → Lane 5  (right)
5th → Lane 6  (far right)
6th → Lane 1  (far left)
7th → Lane 7  (extreme right)
8th → Lane 8  (extreme far right)
```

**Heat 1 Sheet Format:**

| Lane | Sl | Bib # | Name | College | Time |
|------|-----|-------|------|---------|------|
| 3 | 1 | 1001 | Rajesh Kumar | RVCE | |
| 4 | 2 | 1003 | Amit Patel | MSRIT | |
| 2 | 3 | 1005 | Vikram Singh | RVCE | |
| 5 | 4 | 1007 | Karthik Rao | BMSCE | |

### RELAY HEATS

- Rank 1 team → Heat 1, Lane 3
- Rank 2 team → Heat 2, Lane 4
- Rank 3 team → Heat 2, Lane 2

### NO HEATS FOR JUMP/THROW/COMBINED

# 🧮 SCORING CALCULATIONS

## TIME-BASED RANKING (Track Events)

```javascript
// Convert MM:SS.MS to milliseconds
function timeToMs(timeStr) {
  const [minutes, rest] = timeStr.split(':');
  const [seconds, ms] = rest.split('.');
  return parseInt(minutes) * 60000 + parseInt(seconds) * 1000 + parseInt(ms);
}

// Compare: lower is better
const time1 = timeToMs("10:45"); // 10450ms
const time2 = timeToMs("10:56"); // 10560ms
// time1 < time2 → time1 is faster (better rank)
```

## DISTANCE-BASED RANKING (Jump/Throw)

```javascript
// Compare: higher is better
const distance1 = 5.71; // meters
const distance2 = 5.64; // meters
// distance1 > distance2 → distance1 is better (better rank)
```

## RELAY RANKING (Team Time)

```javascript
// Team A: 42.12s
// Team B: 42.45s
// Team C: 42.78s
// Lower total time → better rank
```

## AFI POINTS CALCULATION

```javascript
function calculateAFIPoints(event, performance) {
  const coefficients = {
    '100m': { A: 25.4347, B: 18, C: 1.81 },
    'LongJump': { A: 0.14354, B: 220, C: 1.4 },
    'ShotPut': { A: 51.39, B: 1.5, C: 1.05 },
    // ... more events
  };
  
  const { A, B, C } = coefficients[event];
  const points = A * Math.pow((B - performance), C);
  return Math.round(points);
}

// Example: 100m with time 11.20s
const points = calculateAFIPoints('100m', 11.20);
// = 25.4347 * (18 - 11.20)^1.81
// = 25.4347 * 6.80^1.81
// ≈ 825 points
```

## MEDAL POINTS

```javascript
function calculateMedalPoints(rank) {
  const points = {
    1: 5,  // Gold
    2: 3,  // Silver
    3: 1   // Bronze
  };
  return points[rank] || 0;
}
```
