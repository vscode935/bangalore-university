## 🎯 KEY ALGORITHMS

### Lane Assignment Pattern
```javascript
Ranks 1-8 → Lanes: [3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 1, 7, 8]
Rank 1 → Lane 3 (center-left)
Rank 2 → Lane 4 (center-right)
... pattern continues
```

### Heat Distribution (Track/Relay)
```javascript
Heat 1: Odd ranks (1, 3, 5, 7)
Heat 2: Even ranks (2, 4, 6, 8)
Each assigned lanes from pattern
```

### Ranking Logic
```javascript
Track/Relay:   Sort ascending (lower time = better)
Jump/Throw:    Sort descending (higher distance = better)
Combined:      Sort descending (higher points = better)
```

### Time Conversion
```javascript
"10:45" → 10450 milliseconds
"00:52.30" → 52300 milliseconds
Convert for accurate sorting
```
